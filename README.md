## Bot to make using Neural Transfer and GAN processing easier
The screenshots of bot working can be found here:

To start, select what you want to do: Neural Transfer style via pretrained model from tensorflow-hub based on VGG19 or Create anime art.

Colors are matched from pretrained Hayao .pth weights https://github.com/ptran1203/pytorch-animeGAN or Chainsawman weights which i got after training AnimeGAN on first season of CSM.

Bot is made via telebot and uses global states to define which model to use to evaluate needed output.

It is hosted on private server for easier handling, so it is available by request only.

PART OF THIS CODE IS FROM @ptran1203 github (AnimeGAN model)
