##Bot to make using Neural Transfer and GAN processing easier
The video of bot working can be found here:

To start, select what you want to do: Neural Transfer style via pretrained model from tensorflow-hub based on VGG19 or Create anime art.

Colors are matched from pretrained Hayao .pth weights https://github.com/ptran1203/pytorch-animeGAN or Chainsawman weights which i got after training AnimeGAN on first season of CSM.

Bot is made via telebot and uses global states to define which model to use to evaluate needed output.
